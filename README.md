# Unity 3D Mobile Template for Hyper Casual game


Overview
This project is a hypercasual game created using Unity 3D. The game features an infinite generation of obstacles that the player must dodge. I've developed scripts for handling obstacles, player controls, and animations triggered when the player collides with obstacles. The game utilizes Unity-provided functions to enhance its functionality and performance.
